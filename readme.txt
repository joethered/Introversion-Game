Introversion: A Party Game

How to play:
Conversation Mode:
	Arrow keys: Move Cursor
	Enter or Space: Select Item
	Esc: Go back a Menu

	Obective: Try to match similar conversation topics with other party goers.  Similar 	topics are associated by colors.  Match enough to gain friends; but if you run out of 	stamina, you will retreat to your imagination!


Platformer Mode:
	Left/Right: Move
	Up: Jump

	Objective: At the moment, nothing.  Just have fun jumping around.

Secret Debug Controls:
	Numpad 1: Jump to conversation Mode.
	Numpad 2: Jump to Platformer Mode
	Delete: quit game (an awkard choice, I know)

Innovation 1: Using an JRPG battle system create and abstract representation of a conversation from the persective of an introvert.

Innovation 2: Using the juxtaposition of various gameplay styles to create meaning.  Specifically, the Convessation is meant to be somewhat confusing and intimidating, while the various mini-games are meant to be easy to play and fun.  Thus this represents that the introvert(player) has more fun in his imagination than in a conversation.
